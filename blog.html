            <h1>1.Localstorage and Sessionstorage difference?</h1>
            <h5>Ans: sessionStorage is similar to localStorage ; the difference is that while data in localStorage doesn't expire, data in sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends. Whenever a document is loaded in a particular tab in the browser, a unique page session gets created and assigned to that particular tab.</h5>

            <h1>2.Global scope and block scope difference?</h1>
            <h5>Ans: The variables defined outside of any function or curly brackets are known as global variables and have global scope. Global scope means that the variables can be accessed from any part of that program, any function or conditional state can access that variable and So far, we’ve seen variables defined with the var keyword. Var can declare a variable either in the global or local scope. The variables that are declared within the block scope are comparable to local ones. They are available within the block that they are defined.</h5>

            <h1>3.How to work event loop in js?</h1>
            <h5>Ans: The Event Loop has one simple job — to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.</h5>
